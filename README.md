## Goals

The main goal is to take this opportunity to learn and code in Rust language.

I do not seek to have the most well-written code (since I am learning it) nor the most efficient code either.

## Days

- [--- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---](/d01/)
- [--- Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors ---](/d02/rock_paper_scissors.md)
